## Getting Started

Requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
- https://yarnpkg.com/ (optional)

For more information on Grunt, see the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide.

If Node.js and Grunt are installed navigate to the destination folder using the Node.js command prompt.

For example:
```bash
cd C:\Development\GIT\simple-grunt-starter
```

### Development
To get started we will need to install the required packages specified in package.json. This is done by entering the following command in your Node.js command prompt:
```bash
yarn
```
or ( if you don't have Yarn )
```bash
npm install
```

Now that the required packages are installed run the following command to create the folders and copy the required fonts to the dist folder:
```bash
grunt init
```

Now to start making your changes run:
```bash
grunt
```

Every time you change a file the watch task will trigger and compile everything in the dist folder!

### Production
Ready to go live? Run the following command to minify your files:
```bash
grunt build
```

Don't forget to change the paths in your html to the .min version or use index.min.html!
